# Solar Panel Fault Detection Using Deep Learning: A Computer Vision Approach

## Abstract
This research presents an automated system for detecting and classifying faults in solar panels using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system can identify six distinct categories of faults: bird droppings, clean panels, dusty panels, electrical damage, physical damage, and snow coverage. Using an EfficientNetB0-based architecture, our model achieves high accuracy in real-time fault detection, making it suitable for industrial applications.
